## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable. The green colour palette chosen is to reflect the emotion of envy.

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.
After forking the Repository written by Dr.Karen Cochrane and David Han, Nia Brathwaite did not use any GenAI to modify the code to showcase the emotion of envy. She used HEX Colour codes gained from https://htmlcolorcodes.com.
